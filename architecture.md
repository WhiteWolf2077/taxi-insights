## ðŸ”§ 1. System Architecture

### 1.1 User Interface: WhatsApp

* Powered via Meta WhatsApp Business API
* No app required â€“ chat-only experience
* Inputs: text, photo (for PCNs), voice (optional), location pin

### 1.2 Core Brain: Claude LLM (via API)

* Interprets user messages
* Detects intent ("Oi, where's busy?", "Appeal this PCN")
* Injects memory: vehicle, PCN history, location, driver tier
* Decides on action/tool execution

### 1.3 Contextual Memory Engine

* Lightweight memory using Redis or KV store
* Per-driver: last known location, fine history, points tally, subscriptions
* Injected as structured prompt context

### 1.4 Toolchain (Modular Tools)

* `get_hotspots(lat, lon)`
* `get_uber_surge_predictions()`
* `get_live_events(lat, lon)`
* `scrape_social_signals(lat, lon)`
* `generate_pcn_appeal(image_url|text)`
* `generate_daily_brief(driver_id)`
* `get_driver_risk(driver_id)`

Claude is prompted to use one or more tools and returns structured output.

### 1.5 External Data Sources

* **PredictHQ** â†’ events, weather, flights, transport
* **Social Media APIs (X, Reddit, TikTok)** â†’ trends, crowds
* **TfL API** â†’ disruptions, traffic
* **Uber API/Scraper** â†’ surge hints

### 1.6 Media Handling

* Image OCR â†’ extract PCN info
* Voice-to-text via local Whisper
* File uploads temporarily stored (S3 or local bucket)

### 1.7 PDF Generator (Fine Appeals)

* Claude outputs legal letter text
* System converts to formatted PDF
* Delivered to driver over WhatsApp

### 1.8 Subscriptions + Access

* Stripe integration for payments
* Tier logic: Pro, Daily Pass, Free Trial
* Subscription memory injected into Claude prompt
